    Assignment synopsis:
        The goal of this project is to implement a simplified DNS system consisting of a client program and two server programs: RS (a simplified root DNS server) and TS (a simplified top-level DNS server). In project 0 (your first HW), you have already seen a client-server program with one socket each in the client and the server. In this project, you will extend that implementation to have two sockets in the client program. One socket will be used to communicate with RS and the other with TS.
