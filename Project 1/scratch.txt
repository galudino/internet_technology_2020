0.
client provides:
    rs_hostname rs_listen_port ts_listen_port
        e.g. pwd.cs.rutgers.edu 8345 50007
1.
client connects to RS
    sends rs_hostname (queried_hostname) to RS

2.
RS does a lookup in DNS_table:
    key: rs_hostname (aka queried_hostname)
    value: [ip_addr, flagtype]: namedtuple

    if match:
        RS sends back to client:
            queried_hostname ip_addr A
            (e.g. pwd.cs.rutgers.edu 1xx.1xx.x.x A)
    else if no match:
        RS sends back to client
            ts_hostname - NS
            (e.g. cs.rutgers.edu - NS)

3.
if client received string with flagtype portion 'A':
    output entire string to stdout as is
    (e.g. pwd.cs.rutgers.edu 1xx.1xx.x.x A)
    done.

else if client received string with flagtype portion 'NS':
    use ts_hostname portion of received string
    to determine ip_addr of machine running TS program
    then connect to TS program using another socket
    (e.g. will use cs.rutgers.edu to determine ip_addr of TS program)
    not done.

4. (if not done)
client connects to TS
    sends ts_hostname (portion of received string from RS) to TS.
    (e.g. sends 'cs.rutgers.edu' to TS)

    TS does a lookup in DNS_table:
    key: ts_hostname (aka queried_hostname)
    value: [ip_addr, flagtype]: namedtuple

    if match:
        TS sends back to client:
            queried_hostname ip_addr A
            (e.g. pwd.cs.rutgers.edu 1xx.1xx.x.x A)
    else if no match:
        TS sends back to client
            queried_hostname - error: HOST NOT FOUND
            (e.g. cs.rutgers.edu - NS)

    client will then output string received from TS as is.
    done.
