            Section 02

    Assignment synopsis:
        In this project, you will set up a small IP network consisting of hosts
        and a router.

        YOur network will function with full end-to-end connectivity,
        and you will experiment with tools like ping and traceroute.

        Consider the following network topology:
            
            h1    h2
              \  /
               R1
              /  \
            h3    h4

        Here, R1 is an IP router and h1, h2, h3, and h4 are endpoints.
        In a safe, experimental setting running inside of a virtual machine,
        you will use the ip suite of commands to set up the correct IP
        addresses for all of the interfaces, and the correct routing table
        entries for all of the routers and endpoints in this network.
