-Test network
    -using ping and traceroute commands

    if error

-Do commands.txt - this is where your work will be!
    -will consist of bash shell commands, and mininet commands
    -will only use ping and traceroute to test connectivity
    -mininet should not crash when running commands.txt

-Do README
