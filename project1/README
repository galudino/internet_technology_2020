    Assignment synopsis:
        The goal of this project is to implement a simplified DNS system consisting of a client program and two server programs: RS (a simplified root DNS server) and TS (a simplified top-level DNS server). In project 0 (your first HW), you have already seen a client-server program with one socket each in the client and the server. In this project, you will extend that implementation to have two sockets in the client program. One socket will be used to communicate with RS and the other with TS.

1. Briefly discuss how you implemented your recursive client functionality.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I started by carrying over some functions from HW 1 that could be reused
(in utils.py):
    file_to_list
        opens a file and returns a list of strings
        with each element being a line from the file
    str_to_list
        takes an input string and returns a list of substrings
        with each element being a substring delimited by a parameter string
        (in this case, the delimiter would be whitespace, or ' ')
    write_to_file_from_list
        Takes a list and writes each element from that list to a file
            If the file does not exist, it will be created first
            Then contents of list will be written or appended to the file (based on input parameter flag 'w' or 'a')

Then I wrote if/else blocks for client.py, rs.py, and ts.py
to check for proper command line argument count when
these scripts are invoked in the terminal.

If the argument count is incorrect for a given script,
a usage string will print to STDOUT demonstrating what
the proper use cases are for each .py file.

In client.py,
    a list named hostname_list will be used to cache the hostnames
    that will be queried and sent to the RS/TS servers.
    The function file_to_list is used here for this purpose.

    If the hostname_list is not empty,
        we go the query_servers routine, and send in the following:
            rs_hostname - the hostname for the desired RS server
            rs_portno   - the port number for the desired RS server
            hostname_list - list of hostnames to query (from the input file)
            ts_portno   - the port number for the desired TS server (if needed)
        The query_servers routine will return a list named resolved_list,
        which consists of the strings sent back from RS or TS that will be
        written to the final output file.

        Within query_servers:
            A client socket connection to RS will be opened.
            Then, for each element from the hostname_list:
                queried_hostname = element
                message_out = queried_hostname

                send message_out to RS
                receive message_in from RS and decode as received_string

                take received_string and use str_to_list to parse it
                into a list of strings. (generated_list) 
                a well-formed received string should generate a list of size 3.

                if generated_list[2] (parsed received_string) has the 'A' flag:
                    append received_string to resolved_list
                else if generated_list[2] has the 'NS' flag:
                    open a new client socket connection to TS using
                    generated_list[0], the TS hostname.

                    send message_out to TS
                    receive message_in from TS and decode as received_string

                    append received_string to resolved_list.

    Finally, if resolved_list is not empty,
        we append the contents of resolved_list to a file named output_file_str.

In rs.py/ts.py (they work just about the same):
    - Check the argument count
    - Populate the table (type DNS_table) from input_file_str
    - Open a listening server socket, bind it with ('', rs_portno)

    Then, in an infinite while loop:
        receive data from a prospective client,
        along with their client_binding (hostname, portno)

        receive message_in from the client
        queried_hostname = message_in.decode('utf-8')

        search the DNS_table with key queried_hostname
            if the table has the hostname:
                send back the { key : value } pair in string form from the table
            else:
                for RS, send back to client
                    'queried_hostname - NS'
                for TS, send back to client
                    'queried_hostname - Error:HOST NOT FOUND'

dns_module.py 
    contains an object called DNS_table,
    which is an ADT that encapsulates a dictionary and the
    hostname for the TS server.

    The DNS_table type is populated with entries from
    an input file, using a append_from_file method.

    The key will be the hostname parsed,
    and the value is an inner namedtuple type called addrflag --
    which consists of the ipaddress as the first element of the tuple,
    and a flagtype, which is an inner class of type flag(Enum).

2. Are there known issues or functions that aren’t working currently in your attached code? If so, explain.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No issues thus far, but more testing is needed to confirm any issues.
I have a feeling it needs to be more robust so that it can survive
certain test cases.

3. What problems did you face developing code for this project?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only problems I had was learning how to do certain things in Python,
as I am learning the language for the first time. I like it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. What did you learn by working on this project?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Systems Programming (CS214), we did work on TCP Sockets for our last project(multi-threaded client/server mailbox program) - so there weren't any new
concepts for me here. I'd say working with UDP sockets are what's new for me, and of course doing everything in Python. 

However, the socket interface is a direct transliteration of the C socket API, so it's not too unfamiliar.
