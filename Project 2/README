    Assignment synopsis:
        In project 2, we will explore a design that implements load balancing among DNS servers by splitting the set of hostnames across multiple DNS servers.

        You will change the root server from project 1, RS, into a load-balancing server LS, that interacts with two top-level domain servers, TS1 and TS2. Only the TS servers store mappings from hostnames to IP addresses; the LS does not. 
        
        Further, the mappings stored by the TS servers do not overlap with each other; as a result, AT MOST ONE of the two TS servers will send a response to LS. 
        
        Overall, you will have four programs: the client, the load-balancing server (LS), and two DNS servers (TS1 and TS2).

        Each query proceeds as follows. 
        The client program makes the query (in the form of a hostname) to the LS. LS then forwards the query to _both_ TS1 and TS2. 
    
        However, at most one of TS1 and TS2 contain the IP address for this hostname. Only when a TS server contains a mapping will it respond to LS; otherwise, that TS sends nothing back.

        There are three possibilities. Either (1) LS receives a response from TS1, or (2) LS receives a response from TS2, or (3) LS receives no response from either TS1 or TS2 within a fixed timeout interval (see details below).
        
        If the LS receives a response (cases (1) and (2) above), it forwards the response as is to the client. If it times out waiting for a response (case 3) it sends an error string to the client. More details will follow.
        
        Please see the attached pictures showing interactions among the different programs.
